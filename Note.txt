Middleware

In the context of web development, a middleware is software that acts as an intermediary 
between a client and a server, or between different components of an application. It intercepts 
requests and responses, allowing you to perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, 
data transformation, error handling, and more.

Middleware sits between the client and the server in the request-response cycle. When a request 
is made to the server, it passes through one or more middleware functions before reaching the intended 
route handler. Similarly, when a response is sent back from the server to the client, it can pass through 
middleware again before being returned to the client.

Middleware functions typically have access to the request object, the response object, and a next 
function that allows them to pass control to the next middleware function in the chain. This allows
you to modify the request or response, perform some actions, and then either continue processing the
request or short-circuit the chain and send a response back to the client.
